# Deconvolution of Directed Networks
Here I present a method for removing transitive effects from a network thus, retrieving the direct and noise-free original interactions in the network. The approaches for network deconvolution are applicable to both undirected networks as well as to directed networks. 
It is a systematic approach of computing direct dependencies in a direct network by use of local edge weights. The motive is to eliminate the indirect or transitive relationships from a noisy directed network (containing direct and transitive relations). 
Initially, it identifies the subnetworks of smaller orders that may contribute to the transitivity in a network. After this, it removes those edges that are transitive in the chosen subnetwork, from the original network. Thus, it gradually derives the directed network from the observed noisy network. 
In addition to its theoretical impact as a foundational graph theoretic tool, the results suggest network deconvolution is widely applicable for computing direct dependencies in network science across diverse disciplines.
